Solana

"Blockchain is AWS but it's run by strangers".

Solana Program = code that lives on the blockchain
Equals a Smart Contract on Ethereum

Blockchain = AWS, Heroku -> but decentralized, run by validators.

Accounts
Smart Contracts can contain state (eth).
Solana programs are stateless.
On Solana users have Accounts -> like files
We write programs that can talk to files (accounts).
The program doesnt hold a user's data, the accounts does.

Solana vs Ethereum -> is just like comparing programming languages. Pick whatever you want and feel comfortable with. Go, Node, Ruby, Solidity, whatever you like. Pros and cons for all.

Cross chain is the future -> Bridges.

Anchor = Hardhat on Ethereum
anchor init <new-project-name>
